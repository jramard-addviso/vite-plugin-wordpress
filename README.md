# Vite Plugin Wordpress

A plugin to properly integrate a Vite workflow into WordPress.

## How it works

This plugin creates a file named **vite.config.php** in your project's configuration directory, providing the information needed to resolve paths to the various assets generated by Vite.

When Vite runs in development mode, a **.dev** file is generated on the fly at the root of your development folder, containing the URL of the Vite development server.

## Default configuration

```javascript
import WordpressPlugin from 'vite-plugin-wordpress'

export default {
  plugins: [
    WordpressPlugin({
      /**
       * Wether file changes should be watched and cause a reload.
       * Either enable/disable it or provide your own paths to watch.
       * @see https://github.com/arnoson/vite-plugin-live-reload
       * @type {(boolean | string[])}
       */
      watch: true,

      /**
       * The directory where the `.dev` file is placed.
       * @type {string}
       */
      devDir: process.cwd(),

      /**
       * Wordpress's config root.
       * @type {string}
       */
      wordpressConfigDir: 'config',
    }),
  ],
}
```
